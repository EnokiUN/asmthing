# ASM Thing

A repo for me to mess around while I slowly learn how to write proper software
in `x86_64` Intel assembly.

Why bother with assembly? Because I find it fun.

## Building

```sh
make # Builds an executable in dist
make clean # Removes dist/
make run # Runs the executable and builds it if it does not already exist
```
